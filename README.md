#Project 3: Super Duo

* This is the old version of Project 3, which will no longer be accepted after April 4th, 2016.

##Project Overview

You will productionize two apps, taking them from a functional state to a production-ready state. 
This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, 
adding a widget, and adding a library.
Why this Project?

###Super Duo 
gives you an opportunity to diagnose problems in a pair of apps and also practice improving apps. 
These skills are vital to building apps users will love.  
Diagnosing issues with existing apps is key to working on large apps or continuing projects in Android.
Being aware of the common pitfalls in app design frees a developer to produce novel app experiences without
making the same mistakes over and over.
What Will I Learn?

###In this project, you will:
* Diagnose existing issues with an app.
* Make an app accessible to sight-impaired users.
* Allow your app to be localized for distribution in other countries.
* Handle error cases in Android.
* Add a widget to your app experience.
* Leverage the functionality of a library in your app.
* How Will I Complete this Project?

###You will improve two apps for this project:
####Alexandria: A book list and barcode scanner app.
####Football Scores : An app that tracks current and future football matches (soccer, for students in the USA).
You can download the starting code for both apps in the Downloadables section in your Classroom. 
These apps are currently functional, and work in most cases for most users.
Your job will be to take the user feedback in the UX Review node, and implement changes that will make each app production 
ready.
All of the issues you need to address to meet specifications are hinted at in the UX Review. There are also a few optional 
ways in which the apps can be improved that are not mentioned in the UX Review.
